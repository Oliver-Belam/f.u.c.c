# 🖥️ F.U.C.C.  
**Freak User Control Console**  
by **Freak Co.™**  

> *"Expense management for the modern freak household since 1997."*  

---

## 📺 Overview
The **F.U.C.C.** is a retro-style terminal application designed to run on a CRT with a Raspberry Pi.  
It keeps track of household expenses between roommates and calculates both:  

- **Tracker Mode** → how much each person still needs to spend to catch up.  
- **Settlement Mode** → how much each person would owe/pay if you settled immediately.  

Built with **Python** and **JSON persistence**, the F.U.C.C. combines essential financial tools with an ironic corporate vibe.  

---

## ✨ Features
- Add and update expenses per housemate.
- View **totals, tracker balances, and settlement balances**.
- Reset spendings (fresh start for a new tenancy).
- Persistent storage using JSON files.
- Retro “boot screen” experience (coming soon).
- Planned ASCII graphs and timeline visualizations.
